\section{Evaluation}

We evaluated PocketParker in three ways. First, we conducted a controlled
experiment to determine the best parameter settings for our event detector.
Second, we implemented a parking lot simulator to experiment with various
kinds of lots under differing monitored fractions. Finally, we deployed
PocketParker on our campus. We monitored two lots with camera monitoring to
ground truth our predictions. Our evaluations confirm that PocketParker is
efficient and accurate.

\subsection{Detector Experiment}

\input{./figures/experiment_table/table.tex}

To determine the right parameter settings for our transition detector, we
conducted a controlled experiment. During this experiment, accelerometer and
GPS data was collected and stored continuously on each device, and
participants were asked to manually label each transition into and out of the
car. Afterwards, data was processed by a Python simulator implementing the
identical algorithm used by the PocketParker, allowing us measure
accuracy and energy consumption as a function of the detector duty cycle.

Eight volunteers participated, including seven men and one woman. Seven were
right-handed and one was left-handed. Each was asked to conduct the same
experiment ten times: (1) carrying the instrumented phone, walk to their car;
(2) label departure; (3) drive around campus briefly; (4) park and label
arrival; (5) return inside. Since the way the phone is carried while walking
and placed in the car while driving affects the accelerometer readings, care
was taken to generate a good mix of carry and car location styles.
Table~\ref{table-experiment} shows the breakdown. The experiment permitted us
to obtain sensing data from a cross section of individuals possessing
different body morphologies, habits of driving cars, and ways of handling
mobile devices.

Figure~\ref{fig-energy} displays the tradeoff between energy usage and
detection accuracy as a function of the PocketParker duty cycle. Here we
combine an active period of 5s with a inactive period of variable length,
between 5~and~55s, for an overall duty cycle between 0.5 and 0.06. Our
simulator uses energy numbers from the Android Fuel Gauge application
to estimate average power consumption.  This graph measures the accuracy of
detected events in terms of distance from the actual location of the event
labeled by the participant.

As expected, longer duty cycles consume less energy but produce longer
detection latencies which translate into higher distances from the event
location. Note also that departures have higher location error than arrivals
because departing users are driving and therefore traveling more rapidly.
Overall power usage by PocketParker is low, under 10~mW at all duty cycles.
Because PocketParker's ability to map parking events into lots is affected by
the detection distance accuracy, we chose a low total period of 15~s for a
0.25 duty cycle. This allows PocketParker to determine location to within
25~m for arrivals and 80~m for departures. Power consumption at this duty
cycle is 8~mW, representing 4.2\% of the capacity of a 1500~mAh battery over
24~hours.

\caption{\textbf{Power usage vs. detector accuracy.} Energy usage by
PocketParker is low at all duty cycles, so we chose a high duty cycle to
improve accuracy.}

\end{figure}

Using the same data we also examine the false positive and negative rates for
arrivals and departures. This is important since, without explicit user
input, it would be impossible to determine this information while
PocketParker is in use. Figure~\ref{fig-falsepositives} shows PocketParker
can detect 80\% of arrival and departure events correctly at the 0.25 duty
cycle we use. False positive rates are already quite low, and this is before
we apply our GPS availability filter and lot location filters. False
positives decline as the duty cycle decreases because PocketParker has fewer
opportunities to detect user activity.

\subsection{Simulation Results}

To experiment with PocketParker in a more controlled setting, we implemented
a parking lot simulator in Python. Our simulator allows us to simulate any
number of parking lots associated with any number of points of interest with
varying desirability levels. For simplicity during our evaluation, we
simulate two lots 1~and~2 with lot~1 filling before lot~2, although lot
choice by simulated drivers is randomly weighted. Particularly for evaluating
our monitored fraction estimation, we use five types of lots that fill and
empty differently:

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Fast Fill} and \textbf{Slow Fill} fill once per day quickly or
slowly, like a lot associated with a place of work.

\item \textbf{Multiple Fill} represents a lot that rapidly fills and empties
repeatedly during each day, like a campus lot or movie theater.

\item \textbf{High Churn} starts with lot~1 full and experiences continuously
high arrival and departures rates, like an airport parking lot.

\item \textbf{Low Churn} represents underutilized lots that never completely
fill, with lot~2 almost completely unused.

\end{itemize}

Figure~\ref{fig-lotsdescription} shows the arrival and departure rates for
each of the types of lot as well as the resulting per-lot capacity.

\begin{figure*}

\caption{\textbf{Errors in monitored fraction estimation.} Currently
PocketParker is better at estimating the monitored fraction when lots fill
and empty regularly.}

\label{fig-capacityerrors}
\end{figure*}

\subsubsection{Monitored fraction estimation}

Earlier we described our approach to estimated the monitored fraction, a
parameter important to the operation of the PocketParker availability
estimator. Figure~\ref{fig-capacityerrors} shows the results of 10 random
simulations for each lot type. In each case, the monitored fraction estimator
uses a weeks worth of data and proceeds as described previously. The error in
the monitored fraction estimate is shown as a function of the actual
monitored fraction for the simulation used.

For the five types of lots, we would expect PocketParker to do better
monitored fraction estimation when lots fill regularly---Fast Fill, Slow
Fill, and Multiple Fill---and poorly when they do fill erratically or not at
all---High and Low Churn. The results in Figure~\ref{fig-capacityerrors}
generally follow this pattern. Errors for High Churn are quite high, and Low
Churn errors persist even at high monitored driver fractions. This is
natural, as the Low Churn lot never fills.  By contrast, the accuracy rate for
the Fast, Slow and Multiple Fill models improve with an increasing fraction of
monitored drivers.

\subsubsection{Probability and availability}

We now consider how PocketParker adjusts lot availability probabilities.  It
uses these probabilities to rank available lots in response to queries.
Figure~\ref{fig-trackingexample} shows a 24~hour simulation of a Fast Fill
parking lot with a monitored fraction of 0.1 and a 10\% error in the
estimation of the monitored fraction. The ground truth capacity of the lot as
simulated is plotted next to the PocketParker probability that the lot has an
available spot. At the beginning, both lots are marked as free. After lot~1
fills and lot~2 begins to fill, which generates implicit searches
in lot~1, the availability probability of lot~1 drops. It spikes upward
repeatedly due to departures from lot~1---which reset the short-term
probability of an available spot back to 1---but does not equal the
probability for lot~2 again until the point when the departure rate for lot~1
climbs.

\subsubsection{Prediction accuracy}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3.325in]{./simulator/figures/tracking_fastfill_horizontal.pdf}

\caption{\textbf{Availability probabilities tracking lot capacity.} Dips in
the availability probability correspond to times when PocketParker believes
the lot is full. Discontinuities are caused by departures, which set the
instantaneous probability that the lot is available to 1.0.}

\label{fig-trackingexample}
\end{figure}
PocketParker exists to help drivers park efficiently.  To examine its
prediction accuracy, we have PocketParker rank two model lots in order of
preference at regular timesteps and then compare these results with the ground
truth from a simulator.  Finally, we categorize the results as a correct
prediction, a missed opportunity---a case where a more desirable lot was
available than the one that PocketParker recommended---or a waste of
time---where PocketParker sent the user to a full lot.
Table~\ref{table-accuracy} shows data results from simulations run using
varying monitored fractions$f_m$ of drivers.

Also, Figure~\ref{fig-accuracy} shows that several trends can be observed in
the results. First, overall PocketParker does well on most lot types. The
High Churn lot presents the greatest difficulty, which we would expect since
its large number of incoming and outgoing drivers make prediction difficult.
We are also concerned that the High Churn errors are largely waste of time
errors, indicating that PocketParker is frequently sending drivers to the
wrong lot. This is likely because it is predicting that spots are available
longer than they actually are. Clearly more work is needed to determine the
right approach for High Churn lots, and this type of lot may be a better fit
for infrastructure-based solutions.
\input{./simulator/figures/accuracy_table.tex}

Excluding the High Churn lot, the lot with the lowest correct percentage with
a $f_m > 0.1$ is 80\% for the Slow Fill lot.  Accuracy above
this $f_m$ is consistently good for all lots save the High Churn model.  The
Low Churn lot does have a small number of errors but this is because both
lots are usually empty. An unavoidable lower bound to accuracy is imposed by
the frequency of parking PocketParker has the most information about lot
availability during periods of parking events. Once such information stops,
prediction uncertainty grows. Thus, to the degree that PocketParker queries
follow a pattern of arrivals and departures, it will do well.

\subsection{Deployment}

\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{./figures/smallEventsOnThreeParkingLot.pdf}

\caption{\textbf{Map showing 217~parking events detected by PocketParker
during our forty-five-day deployment in three key lots.} Lot~A is considered
the most desirable, and Lots~A~and~B were monitored by cameras to establish
ground truth.}

\label{fig-events}
\end{figure}

Finally, to establish the accuracy of PocketParker we deployed our PocketParker
application on \PhoneLab{}~\cite{phonelab-testbed} after obtaining IRB approval. The only
infrastructure required was the PocketParker server for receiving events and
generating availability estimates. The userbase involved 105 total participants
from \PhoneLab{}.  Over 45 days of monitoring, the PocketParker app  run by
these users
generated \num{10827} events---5916 arrivals and 4911 departures---for an
average of 241 per day. Our main and medical campuses produced 3645 and 846
total events respectively, with non-campus locales contributing to the
remaining 6336 events.

Figure~\ref{fig-events} shows all of the events that occurred in three key
lots that we monitored during our experiment. Our computer science building
is labeled as the point of interest (POI). The three labeled lots were
assigned our building as a destination and desirability indices based on
their proximity. To determine ground truth availability, we positioned four
cameras at locations within the building to monitor lots A~and~B in
Figure~\ref{fig-events}. Despite the fact that many parking events took place
in lot~C, we were unable to locate a suitable vantage point to gather camera
data for that lot. Nexus~S~4G smartphones equipped with fish-eye lenses took
\num{34138} time lapse images each minute for four days. 
%and uploaded them to a central server.

Using these images, we produced lot capacity charts containing the proportion
of free spots in a given lot at a given time. Specifically, we
hand coded the images for the two lots at ten minute intervals. We were
particularly interested in the transition between empty and full states, so we
were careful to ensure that a lot was never marked full even if
there was a single available spot.

We fed these capacity charts, along with parking events in camera-monitored
lots A~and~B, into the PocketParker estimation engine to produce accuracy
results for a four day period.  Table~\ref{table-accuracy} shows results for
our campus deployment. Overall the accuracy of PocketParker is excellent,
achieving 94.2\% accuracy at a monitored driver fraction of 0.2, which we
believe is an accurate estimate of the percentage of PocketParker users using
these lots.
