[FIGURE XYZ]

To furnish further ground truth, we conducted a structured experiment on
[DATE].  Seven volunteers participated, including six men and one woman, six
of whom were right-handed and one of whom was left-handed.  Each was asked to
conduct the same experiment:  carrying a mobile phone, walk out to his car,
drive around briefly, park and walk back inside.  Each participant was further
instructed to repeat this experiment ten times, following set directions as
to where to hold or carry the phone while walking and driving.  Participants
spent approximately three to five minutes per run for a total of slightly
under an hour total for the entire experiment.

The experiment permitted us to obtain sensing data from a cross section of
people posessed of varying body morphologies and different habits of driving
cars and handling mobile devices.
