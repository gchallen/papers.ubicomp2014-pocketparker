Searching for parking spots wastes time while generating frustration and pollution. To address these parking problems, we present PocketParker, a crowdsourcing system that uses smartphones to predict parking lot availability. We consider PocketParker to be an example of a subset of crowdsourcing we call pocketsourcing. Pocketsourcing applications require no explicit user input or additional infrastructure, running effectively without the phone leaving the user's pocket. PocketParker requires no manual event labeling, and users interact with the app only when looking for parking spots. PocketParker clients detects parking and leaving events by leveraging existing activity recognition algorithms. Detected events are used to maintain per-lot availability models allowing the PocketParker server to respond to client availability queries. By estimating the number of hidden drivers—those not using PocketParker—we can use a small fraction of drivers to estimate arrival and departure rates and make accurate predictions. Our evaluation uses multiple data sets to determine the accuracy of each PocketParker component and the system as a whole. We show that PocketParker quickly and correctly detects parking events, and that our availability estimator is accurate and robust to the presence of hidden drivers. Finally, we deploy a prototype and use camera monitoring of several parking lots to ground truth PocketParker's accuracy.
