Searching for parking spots wastes time while generating frustration and harmful vehicle emissions. To address these parking problems, we present PocketParker, a crowdsourcing system that uses smartphones to predict parking lot availability. We consider PocketParker to be a example of a subset of crowdsourcing we call pocketsourcing. Pocketsourcing application require no explicit user input or additional infrastructure, and can run effectively without the smartphone ever leaving the user's pocket. Users interact with PocketParker only when looking for parking spots.

PocketParker detects parking and leaving events by monitoring the smartphone's accelerometer and using a simple activity detection algorithm. Detected events are sent to the PocketParker server, which incorporates them into its parking lot availability model, allowing it to offer to make predictions in response to availability queries. By estimating the number of hidden drivers—those not using PocketParker—we can use the monitored drivers to estimate arrival and departure rates and make accurate predictions.
