\section{Introduction}

We present {\it PocketParker}, a system that predicts parking lot availability
using smartphones. Unlike previous approaches, our goal is to not require any
additional input or infrastructure other than the smartphones used by the users
of PocketParker. We accomplish this goal by combining an activity detector
deployed as a smartphone app that automatically extracts park and depark events
and a prediction model that estimates parking lot availability based on observed
events.
