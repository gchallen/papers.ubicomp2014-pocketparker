\subsection{Activity Detection}

\subsection{Parking Lot Monitoring}

There are a large number of parking lot applications available in the online
smartphone application stores. A typical parking lot application provides
location as well as pricing information and allow reservation of a parking spot.
Some applications also report parking lot availability based on publicly
available information. To the best of our knowledge, there is no application
that automatically infers parking lot availability by monitoring drivers.

Most close to our work is ParkNet~\cite{Mathur:2010:PDS}, a system that
estimates street parking availability. ParkNet uses vehicles equipped with GPS
and a ultrasonic range finder that scan the surrounding areas and detect
empty street parking spots. Compared to ParkNet, our approach relies only on
smartphones and do not require any additional input.

A few systems have been proposed to assist parking using vehicular ad-hoc
networks or crowdsourcing. Delot et al.~\cite{Delot:2009:CRP} propose a parking
lot reservation system in a vehicular network. Chen et al.~\cite{Chen:2012:COS}
proposes a crowdsourcing approach that asks participants to report the
surrounding parking availability. Caliskan et al.~\cite{4212497} propose an
availability prediction model based on information exchanged by vehicles in a
vehicular ad-hoc network. Their approach assumes that for each parking lot,
vehicles that drive by the parking lot receive the parking lot information such
as the capacity, the occupancy, the arrival rate, and the departure rate. Since
the propagation delay in a vehicular network makes this information stale, a
prediction model is used to estimate current availability. In contrast to
our work, this approach assumes that the necessary information is initially
accurately measured at the parking lot.

\subsection{Transportation-Related Projects}

A few previous systems have been proposed to enable automatic transit
tracking~\cite{Biagioni:2011:EAT, Thiagarajan:2010:CTT, Zhou:2012:LWP}. Although
the goals are different, both automatic transit tracking and parking lot
availability monitoring employ an overlapping set of techniques such as activity
detection and location tracking. Thiagarajan et al.~\cite{Thiagarajan:2010:CTT}
propose an automatic, real-time transit tracking approach that uses smartphones
of public transit users as data sources. They propose an algorithm to
detect when a user is traveling in a vehicle and an algorithm to detect if a
vehicle is a public transit vehicle. EasyTracker~\cite{Biagioni:2011:EAT} uses
smartphones deployed in buses to enable automatic transit tracking. The goal of
EasyTracker is to require no other input. The system combines a few mechanisms
to realize this goal such as route extraction, stop extraction, and arrival time
prediction.
