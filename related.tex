There are a large number of parking lot applications available in the online
smartphone application stores. A typical parking lot application provides
location as well as pricing information and allow reservation of a parking spot.
Some applications also report parking lot availability based on publicly
available information. To the best of our knowledge, there is no application
that automatically infers the parking lot availability by monitoring the
drivers.

Most close to our work is ParkNet~\cite{Mathur:2010:PDS}, a system that
estimates street parking availability. ParkNet uses vehicles equipped with GPS
and a ultrasonic range finder that scans the surrounding areas and detects
empty street parking spots. Compared to ParkNet, our approach relies only on
smartphones and do not require any additional input.
