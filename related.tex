There are a large number of parking lot applications available in the online
smartphone application stores. A typical parking lot application provides
location as well as pricing information and allow reservation of a parking spot.
Some applications also report parking lot availability based on publicly
available information. To the best of our knowledge, there is no application
that automatically infers parking lot availability by monitoring drivers.

Most close to our work is ParkNet~\cite{Mathur:2010:PDS}, a system that
estimates street parking availability. ParkNet uses vehicles equipped with GPS
and a ultrasonic range finder that scan the surrounding areas and detect
empty street parking spots. Compared to ParkNet, our approach relies only on
smartphones and do not require any additional input.

A few systems use a vehicular ad-hoc network to enable parking lot availability
detection. Caliskan et. al~\cite{4212497} propose a prediction model based on
homogeneous Markov model
