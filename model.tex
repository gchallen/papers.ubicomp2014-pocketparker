\section{Availability Estimation}
\label{sec-model}

In order for parking events to be useful, they must be incorporated into a
model that allows us to predict where parking is available.  In campus
environments such as ours, virtually all spots are located in lots rather than
on streets.  We thus structure our prediciton engine to answer the probability
that a given parking lot has space available.  This information is used to
determine what lots to search and in what order. PocketParker's estimator uses
the events produced by our parking event detector both to estimate the rates
at which drivers are searching and departing from the lot and to adjust the
availability probability directly. In this section, we present both the design
of the PocketParker client parking lot availability estimator and portions of
the backend server for our system.

\subsection{Overview}

\XXXnote{GWA: May need to rewrite the following after removing the Section
markings.}

Figure~\ref{fig-lots} shows an example setup with two parking lots and two
destinations that are used throughout this section. For each lot PocketParker
maintains a time-varying probability that the lot has $n$ free spots $P(t,
n)$. While we are mainly interested in the probability that the lot has a
space available $P_{free} = \sum_{n > 0} P(t, n)$, we maintain separate
probabilities for each number of free spots so that we can manipulate
individual probabilities in response to events and queries as described
below. We bound the count probability distribution to lie between 0 and the
capacity of the parking lot. 

PocketParker's estimator receives two types of events: arrivals and
departures. However, for each arrival in a given lot, a number of additional
lots may have been searched unsuccessfully, information critical to the
accuracy of our availability model. In the next two sections we describe how
PocketParker determines relationships between parking lots and combines that
information with arrivals to estimate implicit search behavior.

Between events we want to maintain our availability model by estimating the
rate at which departures and searches are taking place. PocketParker must use
the events it can detect to estimate the rate at which events are taking
place in the lot, which includes the effect of drivers not using
PocketParker, which we call \textit{hidden drivers}. Accomplishing this
requires that we estimate the ratio between monitored and hidden drivers.
With an estimate of the hidden driver ratio, we can scale the search and
departure rates accordingly. Finally, we integrate all of this information to
update our availability estimate as arrival and departure events are
received.

\subsection{Estimating Lot Capacity}
\label{subsec-capacity}

PocketParker requires an estimate of lot capacity $C$ in several places.
First, we use this estimate to bound $P(t)$ such that $P(t, n > C) =
0\;\forall\;t$. Second, we use the capacity to determine the number of hidden
drivers. To calculate a lot capacity, we use the location of the parking lot
obtained from the OpenStreetMap database~\cite{openstreetmap}.  We derive the
lot size from its location and then divide the total size by that of a
typical standard parking spot lot design~\cite{parkingdesign}.  In comparing
this estimate with manually counted capacities for the five lots monitored by
our deployment, capacity estimates were in all cases within 6\% of their true
capacities.

Errors in the capacity can result if the size of parking spots in the lot
differ from our estimate, or if the parking lot is not efficiently packed
with spots. Given the incentive of parking lot designers to maximize
capacity, we believe that the second case will be unlikely. 
\begin{comment}
Parking spot
sizes, however, may vary significantly from lot to lot or based on the lot's
location. To improve our estimate, we may need to incorporate
location-specific parking spot size estimates. Alternatively, mapping
databases may be directly annotated with the number of spots per lot.
\end{comment}

\subsection{Lot Relationships}
\label{subsec-lots}
PocketParker's detector identifies only arrivals and departures. However,
understanding and incorporating search behavior is critical to our model. For
example, if we observe the arrival rate fall at a given lot, it may be
because the lot is full, or it may be simply because fewer drivers are
arriving and the lot still has many spaces available.

In order to estimate search behavior, we need to understand the relationships
between parking lots. This requires two additional pieces of data about each
lot: one or more destinations and a desirability index. The destination
represents the place or places where the user is ultimately going after
parking.  In Figure~\ref{fig-lots}, lot~1 may be associated with destinations
A, B and C; while lot~2 is only linked to B.

The desirability index reflects a lot's relative preference to drivers.
We infer a lot's desirability from the locations of actual previously observed
parking events.  We assume that most users will park in desirable lots if they
are available, and may have searched in more desirable lots before parking in
a lot desirable lot. In Figure~\ref{fig-lots}, if Lot~2 is associated with
destination~A it will probably receive a lower desirability score than Lot~1
because it is further away.

\XXXnote{CN -- GPS issue -- ignore (doesn't help)}

While desirability information is not currently part of open mapping databases,
we believe that it is straightforward to collect. Parking lot operators and
business owners can annotate the mapping database with destinations for each
lot. In addition, data from navigation tools may be able to link destinations
automatically with lots by noting where users park after requesting directions
to a particular place. The desirability index may also be determined by
navigation tools observing what lots are searched by users on their way to a
particular destination. Lacking these traces, simple proximity to the
destination may determine the desirability index directly. As example of this
automatic annotation, in Figure~\ref{fig-lots} if both lot~1~and~2 are
associated with destination A, we consider lot~2 less desirable because lot~1
lies between it and the destination.

\subsection{Implicit Searches}
\label{subsec-implicit}

With an understanding of lot relationships we can use observed arrivals to
model implicit---or unobserved---searches. When a user parks in a given lot,
we use the desirability index of the lot to add unsuccessful searches in more
desirable lots associated with the same destination. There are two challenges
to this approach. First, as described above, lots may be associated with
multiple destinations. Second, the user may not have actually performed the
search. After discussing both of these issues below, we continue by
describing how PocketParker incorporates the information from implicit
searches in a way sensitive to these uncertainties.

\subsubsection{Determining the destination}

If a lot is associated with multiple destinations, we cannot initially
determine the destination of the user uniquely. However, this only becomes
important if the two destinations would produce different desirability
rankings for affected lots. For example, in Figure~\ref{fig-lots}, if lots
1~and~2 are both associated with destinations A~and~C, but not with B, then
an arrival with an unknown destination into lot~2 can always be used to
generate an implicit search in lot~1, since the desirability ranking for the
two lots is unchanged if the destination is either A~or~C. However, if both
lots~1~and~2 are associated with all three destinations, then an arrival
detected in lot~2 becomes more ambiguous. If the user was trying to go to
destination~A, it may mean that lot~1 was searched and is full; however, if
they were trying to go to destination~B, it may not indicate anything about
lot~1.

If lot destination annotations are generated by mapping software, we can use
this data to estimate the probability that a user is going to each of the
destinations associated with a particular lot. Instead of generating a single
implicit search in one lot, we generate multiple implicit searches in each of
the lots weighted by the destination probabilities.  Lacking these
probabilities, we simply generate implicit searches in each destination
associated with a given lot.
\XXXnote{Zap this cII (esp the last sentence)?}

Settings such as our suburban campus or shopping malls, where lots
are largely located surrounding buildings rather than between them,
intrinsically minimize such ambiguous instances.  Ultimately, however, it is
a simple matter to track a user's actual destination via sensing and
assign implicit searches based upon that information plus the acual lot in
which the user parked.  The information garnered by this last approach
is not timely enough to suggest desirable lots to that user while parking.
However, it helps refine implicit search and lot desirability data which
helps PocketParker assist future users find spots.


\subsubsection{Speculative searches}

If we do not directly observe a user searching a lot before we detect an
arrival, we cannot be certain that they performed the search. If the
unsearched but preferable lot was available, they may not have searched it
because they preferred to choose the first available spot, enjoyed the
exercise of walking farther to their destination, or wanted to irritate
their passengers. However, these are not the type of users we believe
would benefit from or use our PocketParker application, since finding a
non-optimal parking spot is fairly simple in most cases.

A more interesting case is where a user has not performed a search before
parking in a less-desirable lot because they \textit{believe} the more
desirable lot to be full. Users that park regularly at the same destination
usually have their own mental models for the availability of spots in certain
lots, causing them to discard those lots without searching them if they
believe the probability of finding a spot in the desirable lot is low. While
this behavior can cause users to miss available spots, these speculative
searches are useful inputs since they reflect lots users think are full.

A final corner case that PocketParker does not handle is if all of the lots
for a given destination are full, and many undetected unsuccessful searches
are taking place. On one hand, if all lots are full then the availability of
spots is determined by departures, not arrivals, and so search data is
useless anyway. On the other hand, we would still like to identify this
situation for users that would prefer to avoid destinations where it is
difficult to park. While discussing future work in we point out how
integrating PocketParker into existing navigation applications could address
this problem by making searches explicit, rather than implicit.

\subsection{Hidden Driver Estimation}
\label{subsec-hidden}

Monitored PocketParker users compete for parking spaces with unmonitored
users, which we call \textit{hidden drivers}. While we assume that
PocketParker users are generally representative of the entire driving
population, we do not assume that all or even a large fraction of drivers
will download and install PocketParker. We want our system still to provide
accurate predictions with the limited information caused by hidden drivers.
To accomplish this, PocketParker needs to estimate the percentage of drivers
that are monitored, which we call the \textit{monitored fraction} $f_m$. A
low monitored fraction indicates that few users are using PocketParker,
whereas a high monitored fraction means most are. Put another way, the amount
of uncertainty PocketParker faces when predicting availability is
inversely-proportional to the monitored fraction.

\subsubsection{Importance of monitored fraction estimation}

Two examples will illustrate why we need this information and how it is used.
First, when a monitored driver leaves a parking lot, the monitored fraction
determines how long PocketParker will predict that a spot in that lot is
available. As the monitored fraction increases, the probability of
PocketParker seeing the arrival into the lot that occupies that spot
increases, and we can increase the amount of time that we estimate a spot is
available. On the other hand, as the monitored fraction decreases we see
fewer arrivals and are faced with more uncertainty. Hence, PocketParker
reduces the amount of time it predicts the spot is available. Second,
PocketParker uses the arrival and departure rates of monitored drivers to
estimate changes to parking lot availability over time. Here we must scale
the observed number of events to the actual number of events, which requires
an estimate of the monitored fraction.

\begin{comment}
\begin{figure}

\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{./figures/rates.pdf}

\caption{\textbf{Example of rate estimation.} Spread of each distribution
shows the effect of the monitored fraction on rate certainty.}

\label{fig-rateexample}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Estimating the monitored fraction}
\label{subsubsec-monitored}
\end{comment}

PocketParker estimates the monitored fraction by first determining the
monitored capacity---the capacity of the lot measured by monitored
drivers---and then using our estimate of the lot capacity. Specifically,
given a lot with capacity $C$, the monitored fraction can be estimated as
$f_m = \frac{C_m}{C}$. Our task then becomes estimating the monitored
capacity $C_m$. To estimate the monitored capacity we maintain a running
count $a$ for each lot, decremented when drivers arrive and incremented when
they leave. We can consider $a$ as a estimate of the number of spots
available in the lot scaled by $f_m$, although we do not bound $a$ to be
below the lot capacity or greater than zero.

Figure~\ref{fig-capacityexample} shows an example of the running count for
two related lots over seven days using data generated by our lot simulator
described in more detail in the evaluation. Both lots have capacity 200 and
the actual monitored fraction is 0.1. As the data shows, the running count
experiences long-period (greater than one day) fluctuations due to events
missed by our event detector and the randomness associated with the small
percentage of drivers being monitored. However, the data also contains
short-period (less than one day) fluctuations caused by the dynamics of the
lot being monitored, and these fluctuations are roughly the size of the
monitored capacity $C_m$, which in this case is 20 spots.

This observation motivates the design of our monitored capacity estimator.
First, we bin the data into 24~hour intervals. Next, we identify the largest
availability swing over each window. Finally, we average multiple swings
together for a period of days to determine the final estimate. This simple
approach works well on lots that fill on a regular basis. For the example in
Figure~\ref{fig-capacityexample}, our estimator estimates the monitored
capacity of lots~1~and~2 as 21.01 and 21.08, respectively, within 10\% of the
true value in both cases. We perform a further analysis of our capacity
estimator using multiple lot simulations in the evaluation.

For lots that do not fill, or do not fill regularly, we may need to produce a
weighted sum where larger swings are weighted more heavily given our
assumption that they more accurately measure the true monitored capacity of
the lot. Another approach is to use the monitored fraction estimated at
desirable lots for a given destination, which are more likely to fill
completely and often, to estimate the monitored fraction for other
less-desirable lots. Here we are making the reasonable assumption that lots
connected to the same destination share similar fractions of PocketParker
users. Finally, PocketParker's monitored fraction estimator runs periodically
to incorporate changes in the monitored fraction caused by increasing use of
PocketParker.

\subsection{Rate Estimation}
\label{subsec-rates}

When PocketParker receives arrival and departure event information, it knows
something concrete about the state of the lot. However, to predict
availability at other times we need to adjust our estimation based on
recently-observed events, which we call rate estimation. To estimate the rate
of events in the entire population including hidden drivers, PocketParker
must scale its rate of parking events by monitored drivers appropriately.
Next, we use these scaled estimates to adjust the probability that a given
lot has a certain number of spots and has spots available.

During a time interval $t_0$ to $t_1$, PocketParker will observe some number
of searches $s_{obs}(t_0, t_1)$ or departures $d_{obs}(t_0, t_1)$ in any
given lot\footnote{Without loss of generality our examples of scaling and
estimating rates use notation for the search rate.}. Note that the search
count includes both arrivals---successful searches---and implicit
unsuccessful searches derived from arrivals at related lots as explained
above. However, depending on the monitored fraction $f_m$ the true count
$s_{true}(t_0, t_1)$ is likely to be much larger. Rather than simply scaling
the count by $\frac{1}{f_m}$, we want to determine the probability
distribution over all possible true counts given the rate we observed and the
estimated monitored fraction. One reason we do not simply scale by
$\frac{1}{f_m}$ is that our uncertainty about the true count should be
affected by $f_m$. If all drivers use PocketParker, we know the true count
exactly; if few do, we should be uncertain.

To compute the probability distribution we treat $s_{obs}$ as the output of a
binomial distribution with probability $f_m$ and vary the number of trials.
Specifically:
%
\begin{equation} P(s_{true}| s_{obs}) = C \cdot {s_{obs} \choose s_{true}}
f_m^{(s_{obs})} \cdot (1 - f_m)^{(s_{true} - s_{obs})} \end{equation}
%
where $C$ is a renormalization constant equal to $\sum_{s_{true}} P$.
\begin{comment}
Figure~\ref{fig-rateexample} shows the resulting distribution for three
different values of $f_m$ with $s_{true} = 200$. While for all four values of
$f_m$, 200 is the most likely true count, as we desired the spread of the
distribution increases with decreasing $f_m$.
\end{comment}

\subsubsection{Updating the count probabilities}
Given the probability that a lot has $n$ free spots at time $t_0$, $P(t_0,
n)$, we want to estimate the probabilities $P(t_1, n)$ at a later time $t_1$.
PocketParker uses recently-observed arrivals, implicit searches and
departures to estimate the search $s_{est}$ and departure $d_{est}$ rates the
lot experienced between $t_0$ and $t_1$. Currently, we use arrival and
departures over a fixed-size window of time $I$ before $t_0$, $s_{obs}(t_0 -
I, t_0)$ scaled to the length of the interval $t_0$ to $t_1$:
%
\[s_{est}(t_0, t_1) = s_{obs}(t_0 - I, t_0) \cdot \frac{(t_1 - t_0)}{I} \]
%
The value of $s_{est}(t_0, t_1)$ is then scaled as described above to
determine the distribution of $s_{true}$.  Given the predictable traffic flows
of our campus environment over the course of a term, PocketParker assumes the
rates experienced over the last $I$ time interval will continue. It may be
possible to perform better rate estimation by using historical information,
but this is left as future work.

The distribution of search rates $s_{true}(t_0, t_1)$ represents the
probabilities that the number of available spots in the lot will decline,
whereas the departure rate $d_{true}(t_0, t_1)$ represents the probability
the number of spots will increase due to departures. The convolution of $-1
\cdot s_{true}$ and $d_{true}$, $\Delta(t_0, t_1)$, represents the change in
the number of spots produced by the specific combination of arrival and
departure rates. A further convolution of $\Delta(t_0, t_1)$ with $P(t_0,
n)$ produces $P(t_1, n)$, the desired probability at $t_1$:
%
\[ P(t_1, n) = P(t_0, n) * (-1 \cdot s_{true}(t_0, t_1) * d_{true}(t_0,
t_1)) \]
%
where $*$ represents the discrete convolution.

Note that the convolution of $P$ with $\Delta$ can cause non-zero
probabilities in $P$ that violate our boundary conditions, namely that
$P(n < 0) = 0$ and $P(n > C) = 0$ where $C$ is the estimated capacity of
the lot. To correct this, we simply set $P(n = 0) = \sum_{n < 0} P(n)$
and $P(n = C) = \sum_{n > C} P(n)$, assigning all the probability that
the lot has less that zero free spots to the zero state and all probability
that it has more than the capacity of the lot of free spots to the empty
state.

\subsubsection{Rateless spreading}

If the departure rate exceeds the arrival rate, the probability mass of
$\Delta$ will lie primarily to the positive side and it will shift $P$ in the
positive direction, producing higher probabilities that more spots are
available in the lot and lowering the probability that the lot is full. The
opposite is true when the search rate exceeds the arrival rate.

An important case is intervals during which PocketParker has observed neither
arrivals nor departures in a given lot. In this case, $\Delta$ will be
centered around $0$ but have a spread determined by the monitored fraction.
Its effect on $P$ will be to redistribute the probability mass more evenly
across the entire interval from $0$ to $C$. Taken over many intervals, the
probability of the lot having any number of spots available will equalize,
which is what we would expect: after a long period without any information,
all states become equally likely and we cannot make an accurate prediction of
the state of the lot. Note also that the speed at which the probabilities are
redistributed through rateless spreading is determined again by the monitored
fraction. The fewer drivers we monitor, the more quickly we lose all memory
of the state of the lot.

\end{comment}

Finally, we conclude by describing how PocketParker uses arrival to adjust
its availability model instantaneously at runtime. Each arrival and departure
received at time $t$ represent strong positive information---moments when
PocketParker knows either that a spot just existed (arrival) or now exists
(departure). PocketParker uses these events to adjust the probability
distribution and incorporate this new information. 
\begin{comment}
  Figure~\ref{fig-examples}
displays an example of the effects of departures, arrivals, and searches
discussed below.
\end{comment}

Arrivals provide two somewhat conflicting pieces of information. First,
PocketParker knows that at the time of the arrival there was a spot free, so
in this way arrivals indicate that the lot is not full. However, PocketParker
also knows that immediately after an arrival the lot has one fewer available
spots. So we incorporate arrivals in two steps. First, we set $P(t, 0) = 0$
indicating the availability of a spot and renormalize the distribution.
Second, we shift the entire distribution downward by one spot, $P(t, n) =
P(t, n - 1)$, reflecting the loss of a parking space due to the arrival.
\begin{comment}
Figure~\ref{fig-examples-arrival} shows an example of the effect of an
arrival, including an increase in the probability that the lot has no spots.
\end{comment}

Departures produce a straightforward change to the probability distribution.
When a user departs, we know at that moment that there is a free spot in the
lot, so we can set $P(t, 0) = 0$ and renormalize the distribution. Note that,
since the probability that the lot is free is $P_{free} = \sum_{n > 0} P(t,
n)$, at the exact time of each departure the probability that a spot is free
is equal to 1. 
\begin{comment}
Figure~\ref{fig-examples-departure} shows the hole in the
distribution at zero created by a departure event.
\end{comment}

Unsuccessful implicit searches, in contrast, represent weaker negative
information, both because they were not observed by PocketParker and so may
not have actually taken place, or because they may not have been thorough.
What we want is to increase the probability that the lot is full while
reflecting our current estimate of the lot. We do this by shifting the
availability distribution towards full by some amount $s$, which we refer to
as the \textit{search shift parameter}. So, after an implicit unsuccessful
search, we set $P(t, n) = P(t, n - s)$, with $P(t, 0) = \sum_0^s P(t, n)$.
\begin{comment}
Figure~\ref{fig-examples-search} shows how the distribution shifts towards
zero and probability accumulates in the full state after an unsuccessful
search. 
\end{comment}
The search shift parameter determines how aggressively PocketParker
will use information provided by implicit searches.

\subsubsection{Weighted arrivals and departures}

Shifting the distribution one space on arrivals and departures is the most
conservative approach representing what we definitely know: that one spot is
available. However, if we assume that our monitored drivers are
representative of some larger number of hidden drivers, we may set $P_l(t, n
< X) = 0$ for some $X$ larger than 1 and scaling with $\frac{1}{f_m}$. For
our experiments we choose the conservative approach and set $X = 1$. As
future work we consider how users may customize the behavior of PocketParker
to be more or less aggressive in locating parking spots, trading off time for
a better spot.
