\section{Parking Lot Availability Estimation}
\label{sec-model}

In order for parking events to be useful, they must be incorporated into a
model allowing us to predict parking lot availability. Our goal is to respond
to queries with the probability that a given parking has a space available,
information that can be used in several ways to determine what lots to search
and in what order. In this section, we present the design of the PocketParker
parking lot availability estimator. PocketParker's estimator uses the events
produced by our parking event detector both to estimate the rates at which
drivers are searching and departing from the lot and to adjust the
availability probability directly.

\subsection{Overview}

For each lot $l$, PocketParker maintains a time-varying probability that the
lot has $n$ free spots $P_l(t, X = n)$. While we are mainly interested in the
probability that the lot has a space available $P_l(t, X > 0)$, we maintain
separate probabilities for each number of free spots so that we can
manipulate individual probabilities in response to events and queries as
described below. We bound the count above and below, and briefly describe in
Section~\ref{subsec-capacity} how to estimate lot capacity.

PocketParker's estimator receives two types of events: arrivals and
departures. As described in Section~\ref{FIXME}, a portion of the arrivals
are also annotated with explicit searches. However, for the unannotated
arrivals, searches may have taken place. Section~\ref{subsec-synthetic}
describeshow PocketParker uses the annotated arrivals to estimate implicit
search behavior for unannotated arrivals. Section~\ref{subsec-online} further
describes how we incorporate each kind of information into our availability
model.

Between events we want to maintain our availability model by estimating the
rate at which departures and searches are taking place. PocketParker must use
the events it can detect to estimate the rate at which events are taking
place in the lot, which includes the effect of drivers not using
PocketParker, which we call \textit{hidden drivers}. Accomplishing this
requires that we estimate the ratio between monitored and hidden drivers, and
we describe an approach to doing so in Section~\ref{subsec-hidden}. With an
estimate of the hidden driver ratio, we can scale the search and departure
rates according, described in Section~\ref{subsec-rates}.

\subsection{Estimating Lot Capacity}
\label{subsec-capacity}

PocketParker requires an estimate of lot capacity $C$ in several places.
First, we use this estimate to bound $P_l(t)$ such that $P_l(t, X > C) =
0\;\forall\;t$. Second, we use the capacity to determine the number of hidden
drivers, explained in more detail in Section~\ref{subsec-hidden}.

Recall from Section~\ref{FIXME} that our false-positive filter uses knowledge
of the location of lots obtained from the OpenStreetMap database. We estimate
the capacity of each lot by converting the location of the lot into a size
and dividing by the size of an average parking spot. Errors in the capacity
can result if the size of parking spots in the lot differ from our estimate,
or if the parking lot is not efficiently packet with spots. Given the
incentive of parking lot designers to maximize capacity, we believe that the
second case will be unlikely. Parking spot sizes, however, may vary
significantly from lot to lot or based on the lot's location. To improve our
estimate, we may need to incorporate location-specific parking spot size
estimates. Alternatively, mapping databases may be directly annotated with
the number of spots per lot.

\subsection{Implicit Searches}
\label{subsec-synthetic}

\subsection{Online Updates}
\label{subsec-online}

Each arrival and departure received represent strong positive information:
moments when PocketParker knows either that a spot just existed (arrival) or
now exists (departure). Unsuccessful searches, in contrast, represent weaker
negative information, either because they may not have actually been observed
by PocketParker (unannotated) or so may not have actually taken place, or
because they may not have been thorough (annotated).

\subsection{Hidden Driver Estimation}
\label{subsec-hidden}

Maintaining an accurate count requires estimating the
percentage of drivers using the lot that are monitored by PocketParker, which
we discuss next.
