\section{Implementation}
\label{sec-implementation}

We crafted the PocketParker system to require minimal infrastructure.  The
client end is a mobile app that installs and runs on Andoid phones.  The
only other item needed is an HTTP server backend.  No additional specific
hardware is required.

The testbed on which we have actually implemented ParkerPocket consists of
a network of Google Nexus 4G phones running Android 4.1 with a backend of
an nginx webserver and PostgreSQL database.
