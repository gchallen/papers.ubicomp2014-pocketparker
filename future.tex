PocketParker presently bases its parking preditions on a fifteen-minute 
limited rolling window of recent parking events. We do not presently tap the
benefit of daily and weekly patterns that would otherwise enhance predictive
accuracy, but hope to do so in the future. Maintaining a database of
previously collected historical data from our own application will increase
the sample size and hence statistical accuracy of our parking preditions.
Integration of ParkerPocket with an existing mobile navigation solution such
as Google Maps would increase exponentially the data we can tap and the
accuracy benefits users will receive.

Access to historical data will also address a present fundamental limitation:
the situation of a lot that fills abruptly, a typical occurence on academic
campuses during class changes. Basing a negative recommendation about a
particular lot's availability solely upon recently acquired unsuccessful
searches implies that a time lag necessarily exists between when users start
discovering on their own that a lot is full and when we have collected enough
data to conclude and somewhat belatedly recommend that a lot is an unwise
option. Having historical data on hand will dissolve this limitation
immediately:  using previous trends, we will be able to time parking
advisories for particular lots before they hit capacity.

An anticipated future enhancement of our appliction, adding capacity to
solicit the exact prefered parking destination from a user, will also
significantly benefit from historical data. We will be able to suggest lots
available to end users based on proximity to logistically preferable but full
lots. If a user further furnishes insight into how long he is willing to wait
for a desired parking location, we will be able to mine historical data for
how long someone in that situation will have to wait for a parking spot and
make recommendations accordingly.

Integration with Google Maps or other navigation solution will permit
automatic retrieval of labeled search preferences in lieu of manual user
input.


Over time, accuracy and popularity of PocketParker should mutually enhance
each other.  Increasingly dense data, stemming from higher user adoption rates
and additional historical information, 

...will enhance accuracy, and hence credibility of the application, with end users...
