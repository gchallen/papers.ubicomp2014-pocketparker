\section{Limitations and Future Work}

The pocketsourcing approach taken by PocketParker makes it easy to integrate
into existing mapping applications, which would provide access to the
estimated half-billion smartphone users that have installed Google Maps. The
increase in the monitored fraction this would represent would significantly
improve PocketParker's accuracy and usability. Integrating PocketParker with a
mapping application provides PocketParker the access to frequent GPS updates
it triggers, allowing PocketParker to provide information about exact spot
location and not only per-lot availability.

PocketParker presently bases its parking predictions on a fifteen-minute
limited rolling window of recent parking events. We do not presently tap the
benefit of daily and weekly patterns that would otherwise enhance predictive
accuracy, but hope to do so in the future. Maintaining a database of
previously collected historical data from our own application will increase
the sample size and hence statistical accuracy of our parking predictions.
This is another area where integration with a mapping application would help,
providing PocketParker with access to much more data.

Finally, we believe that once users begin interacting with PocketParker we
will see different parking preferences emerge. Some user will want
PocketParker to help them aggressively hunt for spots, and be willing to wait
for drivers to leave. Others may be more interested in simply finding a spot
quickly even if it is farther away. PocketParker has several parameters that
can control its predictions, and we will need to determine how to expose
these to users.
