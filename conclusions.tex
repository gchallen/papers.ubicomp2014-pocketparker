\section{Conclusion}

We have presented PocketParker, a pocketsourcing solution for predicting
parking lot availability. PocketParker requires no explicit user input and
can provide parking lot predictions without being removed from a user's
pocket. PocketParker's accuracy derives from combining a simple and
energy-efficient parking event detector with a sophisticated parking lot
availability model that incorporates the effect of hidden drivers that
compete with PocketParker users for parking spots. Our evaluation has
demonstrated that PocketParker can provide accurate predictions across a
variety of parking lot types and patterns, and that a fielded deployment of
PocketParker performed extremely well. We look forward to integrating
PocketParker into existing mapping applications and bringing it to pockets
everywhere.
