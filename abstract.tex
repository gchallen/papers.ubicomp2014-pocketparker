\section*{Abstract}

Searching for parking spots wastes time while generating frustration and
pollution. To address these parking problems, we present
\textit{PocketParker}, a crowdsourcing system that uses smartphones to
predict parking lot availability. We consider PocketParker to be an example
of a subset of crowdsourcing we call \textit{pocketsourcing}. Pocketsourcing
applications require no explicit user input or additional infrastructure,
running effectively without the phone leaving the user's pocket. Users
interact with PocketParker only when looking for parking spots. PocketParker
detects parking and leaving events by leveraging existing activity
recognition algorithms. Detected events are used to maintain per-lot
availability models allows the PocketParker server to respond to client
availability queries. By estimating the number of \textit{hidden
drivers}---those not using PocketParker---we can use a small fraction of
monitored drivers to estimate arrival and departure rates and make accurate
predictions. Our evaluation uses multiple data sets to determine the accuracy
of each PocketParker component and the system as a whole. We show that
PocketParker quickly and correctly detects parking events, and that our
availability estimator is accurate and robust to the presence of hidden
drivers. Finally, we deploy a prototype and use camera monitoring of several
parking lots to demonstrate PocketParker's performance in the wild.
